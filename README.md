# Stock Price Scraper Using Python

This project demonstrates how to scrape live stock prices from a financial website (e.g., Yahoo Finance) using Python libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas`. The scraped data is saved to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Features
- Scrapes live stock prices from Yahoo Finance.
- Saves stock data in a CSV file format for easy analysis and storage.
- Flexible script that can be extended to scrape multiple stocks.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x**
- Required libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `pandas`

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements Setup
Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
```
requests
beautifulsoup4
pandas
```

Run the following command to install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure
The project has a simple structure:
```
.
├── scraper.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

### File Descriptions:
- `scraper.py`: Contains the Python script that scrapes the stock price.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required dependencies for this project.
- `README.md`: The documentation file for the project.

## Steps for Web Scraping

### 1. Import Necessary Libraries
In `scraper.py`, import the required libraries:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
```

### 2. Send HTTP Request
Use the `requests` library to send an HTTP request to the stock price website. In this case, we will scrape stock data from **Yahoo Finance**.
```python
url = "https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?p=AAPL"
response = requests.get(url)
```

### 3. Parse the HTML
Use `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML content and extract the necessary data (e.g., stock price).
```python
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
price = soup.find('fin-streamer', {'data-field': 'regularMarketPrice'}).text
print(f"Apple Stock Price: ${price}")
```

### 4. Save Data to CSV
Once the stock price is fetched, it can be saved into a CSV file for further usage.
```python
data = {'Stock': ['AAPL'], 'Price': [price]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_csv('stock_prices.csv', index=False)
```

## Running the Script
Run the `scraper.py` file to fetch the latest stock price:
```bash
python scraper.py
```
This will scrape the current stock price of Apple (AAPL) and save it to a file named `stock_prices.csv`.

### Example Output:
```
Stock,Price
AAPL,150.23
```

## Customize for Different Stocks
You can customize this script to fetch prices for different stocks by modifying the URL and extracting different data fields. Replace the stock symbol in the URL and adjust the web scraping selectors accordingly.
